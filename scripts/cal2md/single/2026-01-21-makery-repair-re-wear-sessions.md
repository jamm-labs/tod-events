This session is a chance to use the sewing and textiles equipment at the Makery. 
It is also a way to get help with ongoing projects or start new ones. 
Here are some of the things we may be able to help with: 
If you want help doing alterations or repair of clothes and kit.
We can help you get set up on sewing machines and cut out replacement fabric.
We take on community projects involving textiles. If you’re not sure what to do, you could chip in to one of these.
Come and ask about other projects too, like upholstery, curtains etc. We can even repair tents – just come and ask.
