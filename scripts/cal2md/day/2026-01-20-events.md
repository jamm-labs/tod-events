Turn up and Play netball – beginners and experienced people all welcome, come by yourself, or bring your team. It’s very informal – we do a bit of training and then play small 5-a-side games – no commitment necessary. No age limit (at either end!).  £2 if lots of people turn up, £3 if not. It’s about having fun and keeping fit.
